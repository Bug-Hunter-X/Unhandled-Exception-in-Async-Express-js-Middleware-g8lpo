# Unhandled Exception in Async Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications involving unhandled exceptions within asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, where an unhandled exception during a database operation (simulated here) causes the server to crash.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, implements proper error handling using try...catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions and return appropriate responses to the client.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, especially database interactions, can throw exceptions.  If not handled correctly within Express.js middleware, these exceptions can lead to server crashes, hindering application stability and reliability. 

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block to wrap the asynchronous operation. This allows us to catch any potential exceptions, prevent the server crash, and send a proper error response to the client.  This ensures a more robust and user-friendly experience.
